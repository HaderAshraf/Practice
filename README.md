<h1>:point_right:Project idea </h1>
<h5> The main idea of this project is that we control the stepper motor speed through two modes half speed and full speed and we can also control its shutdown using three switches and show the current mode in seven segment. </h5>

<h1> :point_right:Stepper motor </h1>
<h3>A stepper motor has the following features:</h3>
<ul><h4>
  <li> Both-direction rotation </li>
  <li> precision angular incremental changes</li>
  <li> capability for digital control </li>
  <li> holding torque at zero speed </li>
  <li> Unipolar Stepper motor </li>
  <li> repetition of accurate motion or velocity profiles </li>
  </h4>
</ul>
<h3>we choose the unipolar stepper motor:</h3>
<h5>Unipolar stepping motors have a center tap wired to the positive supply on each of two windings. The two ends of each winding are alternately grounded to reverse the direction of the magnetic field. The rotor would require proportionally more poles for higher angular resolutions. 30 degree per step motor is a common permanent magnet motor design. Control sequences in the windings spin the motor. The magnet is rotated one step at a time and the two halves of each winding are never energized at the same time.</h5>
